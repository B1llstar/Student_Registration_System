This fictional Student Registration System is meant to demonstrate
knowledge of three critical areas: front-end, back-end, and DBMS.

As of current, this project will be using JavaScript and MYSQL.
It will use the Node Runtime Environment, with an Express.js framework.
For the front-end, React.js will be used for I/O purposes.
